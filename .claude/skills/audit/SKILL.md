# /audit — Vault Health Check

Scans your entire vault and reports on context health. Identifies what needs attention so your AI outputs stay sharp.

## Usage

```
/audit               → Full vault audit
/audit context       → Audit Context files only
/audit stale         → Show files not updated in 14+ days
/audit orphans       → Show files with no cross-references
```

## Procedure

### 1. Scan All Files

Read every file in:
- `00-Context/` — Core identity
- `01-Decisions/` — Strategic decisions
- `02-Research/` — Market intelligence
- `03-Outputs/` — Generated content
- `04-Daily/` — Daily logs

### 2. Assess Each Dimension

**Depth Score (per file):**
- Skeleton (< 200 bytes)
- Draft (200-500 bytes)
- Working (500-1000 bytes)
- Compounding (1000+ bytes with cross-references)

**Freshness Score:**
- Fresh: updated within 7 days
- Current: updated within 14 days
- Stale: not updated in 14-30 days
- Overdue: not updated in 30+ days

**Connection Score:**
- Count `[[links]]` in and out
- Flag files with zero connections (orphans)
- Flag Context files that reference each other (good)

**Completeness Score:**
- Check each Context file for empty sections (marked with `<!-- -->` comments)
- Calculate percentage of sections filled

### 3. Generate Report

Output a structured report:

```
## Vault Audit — [date]

### Overall Context Power: [score]/100

### Context Files
| File | Depth | Freshness | Connections | Completeness |
|------|-------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| soul.md | Working | Fresh | 3 in / 2 out | 85% |
| audience.md | Draft | Stale | 0 in / 1 out | 40% |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Action Items (Priority Order)
1. [Most impactful enrichment opportunity]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]

### Compound Score Trend
- Total vault files: [n]
- Total cross-references: [n]
- Files at Working+ depth: [n/total]
- Decisions logged this month: [n]
```

### 4. Save Report

Write to `03-Outputs/[date]-vault-audit.md` for historical tracking.
